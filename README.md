### Additional
- `main.ino` was written by [brownfox2k6](https://www.facebook.com/brownfox2k6) (Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng ƒê·∫°i) and [nhakanasi](https://www.facebook.com/an.toduy.3) (T√¥ Duy An)
- `test.ino` was copied from somewhere I don't actually remember ü•≤
- Don't care about the `Draft` folder, I just leave draft code files there for fun üòÅ
-  Also, I would like to thank [Chandramani Dev Pathak](https://github.com/Chandramani04) from [Kashi Institute of Technology](https://www.kashiit.ac.in/), Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India who gave me a free ChatGPT account, which contributed a significant part to the completion of this project. Thank you from my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
-  **Update:** The season ended with the achievement of reaching the semi-finals (top 26 exellent), yay üòäüòäüòä
